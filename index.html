        <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>My name is Thomas and I'm currently a student at Wake Tech studying Computer Programming!  I'm from the mountains in NC but moved to Raleigh in 2021.  I work in an electronics repair shop, so I can't wait to finish this program and start my programming career! I really enjoy front end web develpoment more than machine learning or cyber security.  I feel like web developemnt is a combination of mathematical/analytical coding skills and interior design so I enjoy that.  When I'm not at work or in school, I enjoy getting outside and being in nature: whether it's hiking, kayaking, going for a run, playing disc golf, or even just walking the dog!</p>
